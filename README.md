## 🧠 **Auto Typer App – Project Overview**

### 🔹 **Description:**

The **Auto Typer App** is a lightweight desktop application that simulates human-like typing by automatically entering pre-defined text into active input fields at a set interval. It is particularly useful for automation tasks, repetitive form-filling, online chatting bots for demos, or coding practice.

### 🛠️ **Technologies Used:**

* **Programming Language:** Java
* **IDE:** Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
* **Java Version:** JDK 21 (or compatible version)
* **GUI Framework:** Java Swing (for the interface)
* **Automation Utility:** `java.awt.Robot` class (for simulating keyboard input)

---

### ⚙️ **Key Features:**

* Set **custom text** to type
* Define **typing speed** (delay between characters)
* Set **start/stop hotkey** or button
* Lightweight and **easy-to-use GUI**
* Works across most **Windows-based input fields**

---

### 💻 **How It Works:**

1. The user enters the text into a GUI input field.
2. The user sets the delay (e.g., 100ms per character).
3. When started, the app uses Java's `Robot` class to simulate key presses.
4. Text is "typed" into the active window as if entered by the user.

### 🧪 **Use Cases:**

* Testing input forms
* Automating repeated messages
* Online chatting simulations
* Typing practice software simulation
